MorphX
------
Toolkit for exploration and segmentation of 3D morphologies.

The repository is still under construction and should be considered experimental.

Current features:
- introduction of classes for handling (skeletonized) point clouds and meshes
- point cloud augmentations (rotations, scaling, elastic transforms)
- multiple methods for handling and transforming point cloud attributes
